# 🏢 Ansospace DevOps Ecosystem Blueprint

## 🌐 Vision

Build a **product-ready ecosystem** of modular, secure, scalable internal tools and services that power all current and future applications of your software development company.

From LMS to finance tracking and food delivery — every new product should reuse your platform resources like auth, UI kits, notifications, payments, analytics, etc.

---

## 🧱 Core Architecture

### 1. **Monorepo: `ansospace`**

> Frontend foundation & plugin SDKs

* **apps/web**: public-facing frontends
* **apps/dashboard**: global super-admin dashboard
* **tools/**: publishable, reusable SDKs (auth, notifications, gamification, etc.)
* **packages/**: design system (`ui`), shared types, shared config

#### Core Tools under `tools/`

* `auth-kit`: replace Clerk/Auth0 with your own
* `notification-kit`: self-hostable Mailgun/OneSignal alternative
* `gamification-kit`: leaderboards, XP, badges
* `chat-kit`: reusable internal chat layer
* `seo-kit`, `analytics-kit`: for metadata and business intelligence

> ⚡ **Note:** `ansospace` is an internal-use-only foundation and landing site for platform marketing.

---

### 2. **Microservices** (Polyrepo)

Each is independently deployable, versioned, and language-agnostic.

| Repo                   | Responsibility                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `user-service`         | User identity, roles, RBAC            |
| `notification-service` | Email, push, in-app events            |
| `cms`                  | Blogs, course content, FAQs           |
| `media-service`        | Image uploads, file processing        |
| `billing-service`      | Stripe/webhooks, plans, subscription  |
| `institute-service`    | Colleges, schools, rankings, metadata |
| `quiz-service`         | Create, evaluate, rank quizzes        |

Each service:

* Exposes a REST/gRPC/OpenAPI interface
* Uses Zod/Schema contracts in `shared-types`
* Auth via `auth-kit`
* Traced via `analytics-kit`

---

### 3. **Modular Product Apps (Polyrepos per Product)**

Each product (e.g., LMS, delivery app, school system) should have **separate polyrepos** with the following suggested structure:

```
<product-name>-platform/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/               # Public-facing web app (Next.js)
│   ├── admin/             # Admin panel for managing product-specific logic
├── services/
│   └── <business-service> # Core backend logic
├── packages/
│   └── types/             # App-specific types or utils (optionally share with ansospace)
├── .env.local             # Environment config for local
├── README.md              # Scope and responsibility
```

> ❌ Do NOT include `mobile/` here to avoid bloating dev workflows.

---

### 4. **Shared Mobile Monorepo: `ansomobile`**

> React Native SDKs & Apps

```
ansomobile/
├── apps/
│   ├── delivery-app/       # Mobile delivery app (Expo)
│   ├── lms-app/            # LMS student app
│   ├── school-app/         # School management mobile
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                 # Reusable native components
│   ├── auth-kit/           # Shared mobile auth SDK
│   ├── notification-kit/   # Mobile notifications + Firebase
│   └── types/              # Shared types with ansospace
├── README.md
```

---

### 5. **GitHub Organization Strategy**

Organize your GitHub repos into **teams/folders** using GitHub Projects or naming convention:

#### ⬇️ Recommended Repo Naming

| Scope        | Example Repo                            | Purpose                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Shared Infra | `ansospace`                             | Internal monorepo + landing        |
| SDKs/Plugins | `auth-kit`, `chat-kit`, etc.            | Independent toolkits (npm-publish) |
| Mobile       | `ansomobile`                            | React Native workspace             |
| LMS          | `lms-platform`, `lms-service`           | Product polyrepo                   |
| Delivery     | `delivery-platform`, `delivery-service` | Delivery business logic            |
| School       | `school-platform`, `school-service`     | School management system           |
| Services     | `user-service`, `notification-service`  | Core backend microservices         |

> ✅ Use `platform` suffix for polyrepo apps
> ✅ Use `service` suffix for backends

---

## 🔐 Security by Default

* Zod-based runtime validation for all configs
* JWT & RBAC handled in `auth-kit`
* Role-level UI in `apps/dashboard`
* Use OAuth2 PKCE flows for native apps
* API gateway restricts service exposure
* Internal CLI for secrets management (TBD)

---

## 🏗️ Developer Experience

* `pnpm` + `turborepo`: workspace management
* `changesets`: controlled versioning for publishable packages
* `eslint`, `prettier`, `tsconfig` unified via `@ansospace/config`
* `storybook` for UI packages (planned)
* `nx` or `bazel` optionally later for complex service graph

---

## 📆 Future-Proofing: All Apps Plug-and-Play

Each new app should:

* Consume from `@ansospace/*` SDKs (tools)
* Share UI via `@ansospace/ui`
* Deploy from own polyrepo with shared internal deps
* Integrate with base microservices (user, media, analytics, etc.)
* Ship mobile using `ansomobile` workspace

### Example: School Management System

Uses:

* `auth-kit`, `user-service`
* `notification-kit` for report cards
* `quiz-service` for assessments
* `cms` for content
* `chat-kit` for parent-teacher chat
* `billing-service` for fees
* Mobile app from `ansomobile/school-app`

---

## 🚀 Platform Tooling

* GitHub Actions: CI/CD + publish + tests
* Vercel: frontend hosting
* Railway/Fly.io: microservices
* Sentry/PostHog: logging/telemetry
* Neon/Supabase: storage

---

## 📚 Documentation

* Each repo contains a `SCOPE.md`
* Root docs: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/tooling.md`, `docs/onboarding.md`

---

## 📍 Strategy Summary

✅ **Reusable SDKs** in monorepo
✅ **Stateless, versioned microservices** for logic separation
✅ **Zero-vendor lock-in**: no Mailgun, Clerk, etc.
✅ **Frontend-ready platform** with shared UI + auth + analytics
✅ **Future apps reuse without reinvention**
✅ **Dev-friendly, CI/CD-first, open-core architecture**
✅ **Modular polyrepos for product scaling (web, admin, mobile, service)**
✅ **Dedicated mobile monorepo (`ansomobile`) for scalable native apps**
✅ **Platform tooling for seamless deployment, logging, and analytics**
