# 👋 Welcome to Ansospace

**Ansospace** is a modular, scalable developer ecosystem and platform powering a suite of internal tools, SDKs, microservices, and product applications. We help build fast, secure, and reusable SaaS platforms across web and mobile to accelerate innovation without reinvention.

## 🚀 Our Vision

Create a future-proof, product-ready platform where every application leverages shared authentication, notifications, analytics, payments, UI components, and more — enabling fast, secure, and consistent development.

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

* **ansospace-core** — Core monorepo with reusable SDKs and platform tools
* **ansospace-mobile-sdk** — React Native mobile plugins (auth, chat, UI, etc.)
* **core-services/** — Independent, versioned backend microservices (auth, notify, cms, etc.)
* **product-platforms/** — Product-specific web, admin, mobile apps, and business logic

## 🔧 What We Build

* Modular authentication & notification kits replacing vendor lock-in
* Multi-tenant SaaS platforms like LMS, school management, and delivery apps
* Unified design system and developer tooling for a seamless dev experience
* Secure, extensible microservices with strong API contracts
